# 8051 Microcontroller Keypad and LCD Interface

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates interfacing a 4x3 keypad with an 8051 microcontroller to input data, which is then displayed on a 16x2 LCD. The code allows the user to press keys on the keypad, and the corresponding character is displayed on the LCD.

## Hardware Requirements

- 8051 Microcontroller (e.g., AT89C51)
- 16x2 LCD Display
- 4x3 Keypad
- Resistors (for pull-up configuration)
- Connecting wires
- Breadboard or PCB for assembly
- Power Supply (5V)

## Pin Connections

### 8051 Microcontroller

- **P1.0 to P1.3**: Connected to keypad rows (R1 to R4)
- **P1.4 to P1.6**: Connected to keypad columns (C1 to C3)
- **P2.0**: Connected to RS (Register Select) pin of the LCD
- **P2.1**: Connected to EN (Enable) pin of the LCD
- **P3.0 to P3.7**: Connected to D0-D7 (data lines) of the LCD

### Keypad

- **R1 to R4**: Row pins connected to P1.0 to P1.3
- **C1 to C3**: Column pins connected to P1.4 to P1.6

### LCD

- **RS (Register Select)**: Connected to P2.0
- **EN (Enable)**: Connected to P2.1
- **D0-D7 (Data Lines)**: Connected to P3.0 to P3.7

## Software Description

### Functions

- `init()`: Initializes the LCD by configuring it in 8-bit mode, setting display parameters, and clearing the display.
- `cmd_lcd(unsigned char a)`: Sends a command to the LCD to configure it or move the cursor.
- `data_lcd(unsigned char b)`: Sends a single character to the LCD for display.
- `lcd_str(unsigned char *str)`: Displays a string on the LCD by sending each character one by one.
- `delay(unsigned int i)`: Generates a delay to ensure proper execution of commands and data writes.

### Keypad Operation

- The keypad is scanned by setting all rows low and checking the state of the columns.
- If a column is found to be low (indicating a key press), the corresponding row is set high to identify the pressed key.
- The detected key value is then sent to the LCD for display.

### LCD Commands

- `0x38`: Configures the LCD in 8-bit mode, 2-line display, 5x8 font.
- `0x0C`: Turns on the display with the cursor off.
- `0x80`: Sets the cursor to the beginning of the first line.
- `0xC0`: Sets the cursor to the beginning of the second line.

### Sample Output

- When the program starts, the LCD displays "PRESS ANY KEY".
- When a key is pressed, the corresponding character ('1', '2', '3', etc.) is displayed on the LCD.

## Usage

1. Connect the hardware components as per the pin configuration.
2. Flash the code to the 8051 microcontroller.
3. Upon powering the circuit, the LCD will prompt "PRESS ANY KEY".
4. Press keys on the keypad to see the corresponding characters displayed on the LCD
